# Tokendrink-2025

## Introduction
Tokendrink 2025 is made to encourage people to collaborate on a difficult task together and compete against other people. There are 6 teams, S24, S23, S22, S21, S20 and the oldies (everyone below). Every drink ordered (alcoholic or not) is counted as a point. The group with the most points at the end wins.

## Theme
This year's theme is bariokart (no copyright possible), in which 4 rounds are played, representing the 4 races that are played in a grand prestige. 

## High Level Overview
There are 4 main components to run the tokendrink. The dashboard, data-watcher, game-server and the game itself.
### Data-watcher
Data-watcher is a program that looks at the content of a folder and when a file is added, analyses it and sends the scores to the Dashboard using the game server. There should be one person responsible for occasioanlly downloading the bar bill from pubcard and putting it in this folder (or setting this folder as automatic folder location for downloads).
### Dashboard
The dashboard is the main controller for everything. It will automatically get the results from Data-watcher, but everything can be overwritten using the dashboard in case e.g. a team is winning too much. Whenever a round should start, set the correct values in the dashboard and press the execute command (or whatever it is called, I have not seen the dashboard for a year).
### Game-server
